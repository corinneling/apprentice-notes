# Apprentice Notes
### Exercise Files with My Notes as Comments

#### [Learn Ruby The Hard Way](https://learnrubythehardway.org/book/)
This book is free to read online. It's straight forward, and gives you code to put in your own files and mess around with. That gave me a chance to really understand what was going on with certain ruby elements. Also, ex41 - 43  _helped me understand OOP_ so much better than I had ever before (I hadn't really understood it before). I would highly recommend that section.

#### [Why's Poignant Guide](https://poignant.guide/)
This book is also free to read online (woohoo for free stuff!). It's a fun, interesting read. The _first chapter helped me the most_ as a ruby noob. From there I copied the code examples and created files to test their output, or break them down into smaller parts.

#### [Ruby Bits](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/ruby-bits)
This tutorial is available on [Code School](https://www.codeschool.com). Each level starts with a video explaining ruby syntax and comments. I took notes during these videos, and also copied the code that I didn't understand from the exercises. The _exercises are great practice_, but not overall I didn't take a ton of what I learned to any projects.

#### [MiniTest Magic 8 Ball](https://semaphoreci.com/community/tutorials/getting-started-with-minitest)
This exercise was a _great introduction into MiniTest_, and TDD as a while. It gives you a small project and starts by showing you how to configure MiniTest. Then it goes step by step, following the logic of starting with one test and creating more needed. It's a quick and easy exercise that helped me a lot. It's also on [GitHub](https://github.com/fteem/minitest-intro).

#### [Getting Started with RSpec](https://semaphoreci.com/community/tutorials/getting-started-with-rspec)

From the same website as the MiniTest exercise, and with the same style. It includes step by step instructions on how to set up RSpec and your first test. It was a good introduction to BDD, behavior-driven development.

#### [Mega Project List](https://github.com/karan/Projects)

This is a great list to challenge yourself with, it has the simplest of prompts such as, find e to the nth digit or make a calculator, all the way up to database projects. You can use any language to solve them, and I am planning on revisiting it after working on ruby some more

#### [Book of Ruby](https://www.amazon.com/Book-Ruby-Hands-Guide-Adventurous/dp/1593272944)

This book has a great balance of explanation to examples. I like it because it explains everything assuming you only know a little bit of ruby, yet it also has a 'Digging Deeper' section at the end of each chapter.
