# Apprentice Notes
### Exercise Files with My Notes as Comments

#### [Learn Ruby The Hard Way](https://learnrubythehardway.org/book/)
This book is free to read online. It's straight forward, and gives you code to put in your own files and mess around with. That gave me a chance to really understand what was going on with certain ruby elements. Also, ex41 - 43  _helped me understand OOP_ so much better than I had ever before (I hadn't really understood it before). I would highly recommend that section.

#### [Why's Poignant Guide](https://poignant.guide/)
This book is also free to read online (woohoo for free stuff!). It's a fun, interesting read. The _first chapter helped me the most_ as a ruby noob. From there I copied the code examples and created files to test their output, or break them down into smaller parts.

#### [Ruby Bits](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/ruby-bits)
This tutorial is available on [Code School](https://www.codeschool.com). Each level starts with a video explaining ruby syntax and comments. I took notes during these videos, and also copied the code that I didn't understand from the exercises. The _exercises are great practice_, but not overall I didn't take a ton of what I learned to any projects.
