# "A class is the blueprint for an object. It defines the data an object
# contains and the way it behaves. Many different objects can be created
# from a single class. So, you might have one Cat class but three cat
# objects: tiddles, cuddles, and flossy. A method is like a function or
# subroutine that is defined inside the class."

# a ruby object is defined by a class

# instance variables belong to individual objects of the class

# mydog id the object name
# Dog.new is the instance of the Dog class
mydog = Dog.new

# for pure OOP - the data in each object is private

# data hiding - when only the object itself can chance its internal state

# encapsultaion - describes the fact that an object contains both
# its own data and the methods required to manipulate that data.

# return keyword is optional in ruby methods

# polymorphism - the ability to have different classes containing methods
# with the same name

# constructor - a method that allocates memory for an object and then
# executes the initialize method
