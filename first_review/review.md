Where I started
Knowledge & Experience in HTML, CSS and basic JS functions

Milestone 1: Understand its a process
Milestone 2: Comprehend OOP
Milestone 3: Implement OOP
Milestone 4: Understand TDD and how that can help the development process
Milestone 5: Solve new problems with Katas still using TDD
Milestone 6: Branch out towards interests that have arisen from this process such as:
  - Automation/Efficient workspace
    - set up alfred
    - set up dash
    - added packages to atom
    - refined dotfiles
  - Gems
  - Web Scrapping
  - Pry
  - Blockchain
  - SSH keys

Goals
understand servers and setting up environments
further understand blockchain
look into encryption

I think my main interests are security and setting up environments
and what i am really interested in is understanding how the tools we are using work
