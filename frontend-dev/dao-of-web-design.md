# Dao of Web Design

- Its hard to let go over held tight beliefs
    - This is very true when it comes to transition from print to web 
    "But we need to understand which of these lessons are appropriate for the web, and which mere rituals."
- The designer is not a controller 
    - "..abandon control, and seek a new relationship with the page."
    - The web doesn't have the constraints of print
    - It's flexibility allows us to do more
    - "maintaining flexibility is strength;"
    - "think about what your pages do, not what they look like"
- "use style sheets properly, to suggest the appearance of a page, not to control the appearance of a page, and you don’t rely on your style sheet to convey information"
- what is the best to use? 
    - em
    - px
    - pts
    - rem
    - %
"The web’s greatest strength, I believe, is often seen as a limitation, as a defect. It is the nature of the web to be flexible, and it should be our role as designers and developers to embrace this flexibility, and produce pages which, by being flexible, are accessible to all."
