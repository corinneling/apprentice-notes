# Class
  # Tell ruby to make a new type of thing

# Object
  # Two meanings
  # The most basic type of thing
  # Any instance of some thing

# Instance
  # What you get when you tell Ruby to create a class

# Def
  # How you define a function inside a class

# @
  # inside the functions in a class
  # variable for the instance/object being accessed

# inheritance
  # one class can inherit traits from another class

### We like OOP because its like us, a bunch of things inheriting
### traits from those that came before us
### Yet, we have our own identities and we can choose to build
### on certain traits, and use those, and we can let some traits
### float beneath the surface, always present but never used

# attribute
  # a property classes have that are from composition and are
  # usually variables
